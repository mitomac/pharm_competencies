# Molecular Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program
### Learning Outcome Assessment Plan and Report
### Academic Year 2023-2024

## Program Mission

The Duke University program in Molecular Cancer Biology is designed to train
independent scholars who are interested in augmenting current knowledge on the
basic mechanisms underlying cell growth, differentiation, and development, and
discerning how these processes are perturbed in cancer cells with the goal of
identifying novel candidates for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of
cancer. 

## Program Goals

- To provide a strong foundation in cancer biology while maintaining flexibility to pursue elective courses
tailored for the student’s research interests.
- To train students in creative and innovative approaches to dissect the regulatory networks that control
the molecular, cellular and organismic processes required for tumor progression and metastasis, as well
as therapy resistance.
- To provide training on multi-disciplinary research approaches that include genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, genetics, bioinformatics, state-of-the art “omics” technologies (single cell-RNA-seq, ST, and
ATAC-seq), cell biology, molecular biology and biochemistry.
- A major goal is to identify novel candidates and pathways for therapeutic intervention in the treatment
of cancer and potential translation to the clinic.
- To promote collaborative interactions among investigators across the University, the School of
Medicine, and DCI.


## Learning Objectives, and Measures

Given the above program goals, the objectives of the Molecular Cancer Biology
Program are to instill the following ten core competencies into Duke biomedical
Ph.D. students. Multiple assessment tools measure these core competencies at
various points of time throughout the doctoral training. The Office of
Biomedical Graduate Education (OBGE) at Duke University School of Medicine has
revised and developed assessment tools (for Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis
Committee Meeting, Preliminary Exam, and Dissertation Defense) to measure and
track biomedical Ph.D. trainee's holistic learning objectives.


| Core Competencies | Assessment Tools/Measures |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1. Broad Conceptual Knowledge of a Scientific Discipline | Course-embedded Assessments |
| 2. Deep Knowledge of a Specific Field | Annual Thesis Committee Meeting, Preliminary Exam, Dissertation Defense |
| 3. Critical Thinking Skills | Preliminary Exam, Dissertation Defense |
| 4. Experimental Skills | Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis Committee Meeting, Prelim Exam, Dissertation Defense |
| 5. Computational Skills | - |
| 6. Collaboration and Team Science Skills | Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis Committee Meeting |
| 7. RCR, Research Ethics, and R&R | Preliminary Exam, Dissertation Defense, Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis Committee Meeting |
| 8. Communication Skills | Preliminary Exam, Dissertation Defense |
| 9. Leadership Skills | Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis Committee Meeting, Dissertation Defense |
| 10. Resilience and Survival Skills | Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis Committee Meeting |

The assessment measures for Lab Rotation, Annual Thesis Committee Meeting, Preliminary Exam, and Dissertation Defense were designed to measure nine of those ten core competencies (inclusively), except the first core competency- Broad Conceptual Knowledge of a Scientific Discipline. Each assessment tool contains multiple sets of Student Learning Outcomes as targets/indicators of the core competencies, and the faculty/committee members rate them on a scale of 1 to 5, where1 being "Poor" and 5 being "Superlative."

## Student Learning Outcomes and Targets

### Competency framework:

Competency refers to the capacity to perform a given task using relevant skills, knowledge, attitude, and the like. The competency-based program assessment approach focuses on observing and directly measuring the expected Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) targeted for the predefined competencies. The newly developed Lab Rotation evaluation form and the revised evaluation forms for the Preliminary Examination, Annual Dissertation Committee Meeting, and Dissertation Defense contain Likert-scale items with a 5-point rating scale (1= Poor, 2= Insufficient, 3= Competent, 4= Very good, and 5= Superlative), and the scale items (the SLOs) were initially drafted based on a peer-reviewed published paper (Verderame et al., 2018).

### Rationale for chosen competencies:

Using the Delphi Technique, first, a long list of SLO statements each for the respective evaluation forms was sent to the OBGE Advisory Board (consists of 14 Duke SoM Biomedical interdisciplinary faculty) members to rate the SLOs' relevancy and consistency with the milestones and the relevant learning activities. Then, considering the higher ratings and suggested modifications from the OBGE Advisory Board; finally, 12 SLOs for Lab Rotation, 17 SLOs for Preliminary Examination, 17 SLOs for Annual Dissertation Committee Meeting, and 23 SLOs for Dissertation Defense were retained in these evaluation forms, which are considered as the targeted SLOs. The competencies span training elements within both the formal curriculum and “hidden” curriculum that are correlated with skills necessary for success in graduate school and a variety of post-PhD careers.

## Student Learning Outcomes Assessment Report: Quantitative Section

The targeted SLOs are presented in this section under each core competency headline, followed by the competency-specific program findings, evaluations and resultant action. See Appendix A for the complete Competency-SLOs-Assessment Plan.
